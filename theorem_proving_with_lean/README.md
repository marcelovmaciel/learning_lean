In which I take notes from :  [Theorem Proving in Lean â€” Theorem Proving in Lean 3.23.0 documentation](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/)

- I basically copy and paste parts of the website and add some comments.
- I use [outshine](https://github.com/alphapapa/outshine) to organize the code.
